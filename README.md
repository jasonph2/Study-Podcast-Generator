# Study-Podcast-Generator

This project is an offshoot of my original Polish-Passion-Project. I recognized that much of the base functionality with recording can be easily applied to making a study tool. This can be used to review terms in a podcast formed no matter what discipline you are studying. 

I have more work to do to show the set up steps as well as adjust the UI and naming conventions to reflect a more universal study tool.
